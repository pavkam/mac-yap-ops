/// Guards a real crash this application shipped: a closure literal written

/// lexical context alone, regardless of what it captures. `AVAudioEngine`
/// invokes a recognition tap from its own real-time thread, never the main
/// actor, so a tap block built that way carries a runtime isolation check that
/// fails on the very first buffer — an immediate `EXC_BREAKPOINT`, not a
/// warning, and not something `#expect` can catch after the fact. The
/// regression signal here is the test process surviving at all: if
/// `AppleSpeechSession.makeTap` regresses to a `@MainActor`-inferred closure,
/// this test crashes the same way the app did, on any thread that is not main.
