# Validated ACP compatibility baseline

Snapshot date: 2026-09-06. This is evidence, not an evergreen claim. Live
project code and pins are authoritative; rerun the probe before relying on a
drift-prone local or registry version.

## Local environment

| Component | Validated version |
| --- | --- |
| Cursor Agent CLI | `2026.01.23-916f423` |
| Codex CLI | `0.153.1` |
| Claude Code CLI | `2.1.220` |
| Node.js | `22.18.0` |
| npm / npx | `11.6.4` |

The native Codex and Claude CLIs exposed no ACP server subcommand. YapOps correctly used the pinned npm adapters instead.

## Initialize-only probes

The exact project launch commands were run locally. The probe sent no
credentials and called only ACP `initialize` with protocol version 1 and empty
client capabilities. It did not call authenticate, session, prompt, or
permission methods. Each provider still inherited its normal ambient
configuration.

- Cursor — `cursor-agent acp`: protocol 1, `loadSession: false`, resume absent.
- Codex — `npx -y @agentclientprotocol/codex-acp@1.8.0`: protocol 1,
  `loadSession: true`, resume object.
- Claude — `npx -y @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@0.73.0`: protocol 1,
  `loadSession: true`, resume object.

Probe output is restricted to `protocolVersion`, `loadSession`, and `resume`
shape summaries. It never prints raw capability values, identifiers, provider
metadata, environment variables, stderr, credentials, or response payloads.

Exact pinned packages were available in the local npm cache. Package metadata
showed Codex adapter 1.8.0 using ACP SDK `^1.4.0` and bundled Codex `^0.152.0`;
Claude adapter 0.73.0 used ACP SDK `1.4.0`, Claude Agent SDK `0.3.257`, and Node
`>=22`.

## Registry drift observed

On the snapshot date, npm reported Codex adapter `1.10.0` and Claude adapter
`0.75.1` as `latest`. The project pins intentionally remained at `1.8.0` and
`0.73.0`. A newer tag is compatibility-review input, not an automatic upgrade.

Refresh safely with:

```bash
.agents/skills/acp-integration/scripts/probe-local-clients.sh all
.agents/skills/acp-integration/scripts/probe-local-clients.sh all --online
```

Update this date and only the facts reproduced by the new run. Do not paste raw
initialize payloads, environment variables, credentials, or transient logs.
