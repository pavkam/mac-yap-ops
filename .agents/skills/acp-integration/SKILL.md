# ACP integration

Work from the repository contract, not from provider folklore.

## Load only the affected contract

| When the task touches | Read |
| --- | --- |
| JSON-RPC framing, capabilities, sessions, permissions, cancellation, recovery, bounds | `references/protocol-v1.md` |
| Tests, fakes, local probing, or completion verification | `references/testing.md` |
| Cursor's native server | `references/cursor.md` |
| The pinned Codex adapter | `references/codex.md` |
| The pinned Claude adapter | `references/claude.md` |
| A user-supplied provider | `references/custom-providers.md` |
| Pins, launch commands, compatibility drift, or the local environment | `references/validated-baseline.md` |

Load the protocol reference plus only the provider and verification material the
change needs. Do not preload every client reference.

## Follow this workflow

1. Inspect `AgentHarnessDraft`, `AgentHarnessConfiguration`, the affected ACP
   production type, its focused tests, and `docs/agent-harness.md`.
2. State the violated wire, lifecycle, security, or boundedness invariant.
3. Add the smallest failing deterministic test with `FakeACPTransport` or a
   controlled fake process. Never make unit tests require installed clients,
   credentials, network access, or a paid prompt.
4. Implement the narrow fix. Preserve direct process launch, exact JSON-RPC
   identifiers, current-session routing, ordered delivery, and cancellation.
5. Run the focused tests, then the relevant verification in
   `references/testing.md`.
6. If compatibility itself changed, run `scripts/probe-local-clients.sh`. Its
   default probe sends no credentials and calls only `initialize`; it must not
   call authentication, session, prompt, or permission methods. The provider
   still inherits its normal ambient configuration.
7. Update the provider reference, validation date, launch table, and nearby
   tests in the same change when a preset or pin changes.

## Non-negotiable rules

- ACP v1 over UTF-8 newline-delimited JSON-RPC on stdio is the supported wire.
- Stdout is protocol-only; stderr is bounded diagnostic data.
- Omitted capabilities are unsupported. Do not call an optional method merely
  because one provider happens to accept it.
- Project pins beat registry `latest`. Upgrade only through an explicit change
  with source review, deterministic tests, and an initialize-only handshake.
- Native `codex` and `claude` CLIs are not the configured ACP servers; the
  project uses pinned adapter packages.
- Never log prompts, transcripts, credentials, raw ACP payloads, or unbounded
  provider content.
- Never replay a prompt after any observable agent activity or permission
  request.
