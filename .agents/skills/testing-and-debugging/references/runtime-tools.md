# Runtime and platform tools

## Reproduce in the right artifact

For logic, start with a focused Swift test. For resources, signing, Keychain
identity, Microphone/Speech Recognition permissions, Service Management, or
menu-bar lifecycle, use the real bundle:

```bash
CONFIGURATION=debug make app
open .build/YapOps.app
pgrep -fl YapOps
plutil -lint .build/YapOps.app/Contents/Info.plist
codesign --verify --deep --strict .build/YapOps.app
```

`make app` copies the plist, icon, and sound assets, then signs and verifies the
bundle. Local builds default to the persistent **YapOps Local Development**
Keychain identity; run `make setup-signing` once per Mac. CI explicitly opts into
`SIGN_IDENTITY=-`. Use the same key and app path for permission testing.
Never reset TCC automatically.

If Accessibility stays On in System Settings but the app reports denied after
an update, check TCC's code-requirement failure and the bundle's designated
requirement. Two different `cdhash` requirements confirmed an ad-hoc rebuild
invalidated the existing grant. Preserve the signing identity instead of hiding
the permission action or repeatedly prompting. `scripts/test-build-app.py`
guards the persistent default, explicit ad-hoc opt-in, and preservation of the
previous app when signing or verification fails.

## LLDB

Launch the debug executable:

```bash
lldb .build/YapOps.app/Contents/MacOS/YapOps
```

Or find the PID with `pgrep -x YapOps` and attach with
`lldb -p <PID>`. Useful commands:

```text
breakpoint set --name YapOpsCoordinator.pushToTalkPressed
breakpoint set --file YapOpsCoordinator.swift --line <line>
run
process interrupt
thread backtrace all
frame variable
po <expression>
continue
```

Break where invalid state first crosses a boundary: generation changes,
callback entry, queue admission, pipe closure, cancellation, or model
publication. On a hang, interrupt and collect all thread backtraces before
continuing.

## Crashes and runtime checks

Crash reports usually appear under:

```text
~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/YapOps*
```

Use the complete symbolicated report. Read termination reason, diagnostic
messages, crashed thread, and all backtraces. The last app frame is a starting
point, not a verdict.

```bash
swift test --sanitize=thread
swift test --sanitize=address
```

Use Thread Sanitizer for actors, callbacks, locks, queues, pipes, cancellation,
audio delegates, and UI delivery. Use Address Sanitizer for invalid memory
access and lifetime corruption. Sanitizers add overhead; reproduce without them
too before diagnosing a timing or performance regression.

## Instruments

Use a representative release bundle and the same interaction before and after:

- Time Profiler: CPU cost and unexpected main-thread stacks.
- SwiftUI: expensive or excessively frequent updates.
- Hangs/System Trace: blocked main run loop, waits, and priority inversions.
- Allocations/Leaks: retained panels, tasks, audio objects, transports, and
  unbounded state.

Do not profile a static preview and generalize to streaming behavior. Review
trace contents before sharing: network and other instruments may capture
sensitive values even though the app's JSONL diagnostics do not.
