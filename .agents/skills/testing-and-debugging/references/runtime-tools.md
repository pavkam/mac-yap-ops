# Runtime and platform tools

## Reproduce in the right artifact

For logic, start with a focused Swift test. For resources, signing, Keychain
identity, Microphone/Speech Recognition permissions, Service Management, or
menu-bar lifecycle, use the real bundle:

```bash
CONFIGURATION=debug make app
open .build/YapOps.app
pgrep -fl YapOps
plutil -lint .build/YapOps.app/Contents/Info.plist
codesign --verify --deep --strict .build/YapOps.app
```

`make app` copies the plist, icon, and sound assets, then signs and verifies the
bundle. It defaults to ad-hoc signing; rebuilds can therefore change the privacy
identity. Use an installed development identity and stable app path for repeated
manual permission testing. Never reset TCC automatically.

## LLDB

Launch the debug executable:

```bash
lldb .build/YapOps.app/Contents/MacOS/YapOps
```

Or find the PID with `pgrep -x YapOps` and attach with
`lldb -p <PID>`. Useful commands:

```text
breakpoint set --name YapOpsCoordinator.pushToTalkPressed
breakpoint set --file YapOpsCoordinator.swift --line <line>
run
process interrupt
thread backtrace all
frame variable
po <expression>
continue
```

Break where invalid state first crosses a boundary: generation changes,
callback entry, queue admission, pipe closure, cancellation, or model
publication. On a hang, interrupt and collect all thread backtraces before
continuing.

## Crashes and runtime checks

Crash reports usually appear under:

```text
~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/YapOps*
```

Use the complete symbolicated report. Read termination reason, diagnostic
messages, crashed thread, and all backtraces. The last app frame is a starting
point, not a verdict.

```bash
swift test --sanitize=thread
swift test --sanitize=address
```

Use Thread Sanitizer for actors, callbacks, locks, queues, pipes, cancellation,
audio delegates, and UI delivery. Use Address Sanitizer for invalid memory
access and lifetime corruption. Sanitizers add overhead; reproduce without them
too before diagnosing a timing or performance regression.

## Instruments

Use a representative release bundle and the same interaction before and after:

- Time Profiler: CPU cost and unexpected main-thread stacks.
- SwiftUI: expensive or excessively frequent updates.
- Hangs/System Trace: blocked main run loop, waits, and priority inversions.
- Allocations/Leaks: retained panels, tasks, audio objects, transports, and
  unbounded state.

Do not profile a static preview and generalize to streaming behavior. Review
trace contents before sharing: network and other instruments may capture
sensitive values even though the app's JSONL diagnostics do not.
